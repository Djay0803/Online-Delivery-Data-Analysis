# Online-Delivery-Data-Analysis

In this project, we have a CSV file containing the details of a survey conducted by a food delivery company. Our objective is to analyze the data in the CSV file to help grow the business and enhance customer satisfaction.

The analysis involves various steps such as data cleaning, data exploration, and data visualization. Initially, we clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency. Next, we explore the data by examining different variables and their relationships. This exploration can include statistical measures, correlations, and patterns.

Furthermore, we apply data visualization techniques to present the survey results in a more intuitive and understandable manner. Through charts, graphs, and visual representations, we can identify trends, customer preferences, and areas for improvement.

By conducting this analysis on the CSV file, we aim to extract valuable insights that can drive business growth and enhance customer satisfaction for the food delivery company. The project leverages data analysis techniques to derive actionable recommendations and strategies to improve the company's services and meet customer expectations.
